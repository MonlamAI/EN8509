The Ant and the Grasshopper
In a camp, there lived an ant and a grasshopper who were good friends. It was spring and the grasshopper was having fun playing and singing. But the ant was working hard. It was collecting food and storing it in its house. The grasshopper asked the ant to play with him, but the ant told him that she is collecting food to eat in the winter. The grasshopper laughed at the ant and told her to not worry about the future. The ant ignored him and continued working hard. Winter came and the grasshopper did not find any food to eat. It starved and became very weak. The grasshopper knew that he should have prepared himself for the winter when there was plenty of food in the spring, and realised its mistake.
